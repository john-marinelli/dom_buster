# Dom Buster

## Overview:

Dom Buster is a tool used for testing websites for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, with a particular emphasis on those having to do with the Document Object Model.

It's a dynamic analysis tool that treats a website as a black box, simulating repeated cross-site scripting attempts and reporting back vulnerabilities.

Dom Buster does not require any access to your code base.

## Installation:

Dom Buster uses Selenium and chromedriver to search and interact with webpages. In order to start using the program, you must install both of these.

To install Selenium:

```

pip3 install selenium

```

To get chromedriver, we recommend using a package manager for a quick and easy install. 


On Windows you can use Chocolatey:

```

choco install chromedriver

```


On Mac OS, we recommend using Homebrew:

```

brew --cask install chromedriver

```

On Debian based Linux distributions, you can find chromedriver on apt:

```

sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver

```

One issue with this install method is that some package managers can lag behind Chrome updates. 
You must make sure that your chrome version matches the chromedriver version you download. If a chromedriver download from one of these package managers is of the incorrect version, you can always find the latest at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/.

After downloading:

On Linux make sure you make the file executable, then add it to ~/bin and to your path.

On Mac OS, move the executable to /usr/local/bin.

On Windows, move the executable to C:\Windows.
